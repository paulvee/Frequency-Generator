# Frequency-Generator
Simple frequency generator with fast rise edges

This is part of my Blog posting for this project.
It can be found here: http://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2019/08/frequency-generator-with-fast-edges.html

Version 2.1 of the driver code is for the first version of the hardware.
Version 2.2 was needed due to a change in the layout for the A and B frequency selection

The Gerber files are for the version 2 PCB layout.
I have several extra's so if you're interested, send me a PM
